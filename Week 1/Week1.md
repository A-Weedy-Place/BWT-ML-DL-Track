**GIT:**

      - Git is a version control system.
      
      - Git helps you keep track of code changes.
      
      - Git is used to collaborate on code.

**GIT HUB:**

      - GitHub is a "hub" (a place or platform) where Git users build software together. 
        GitHub is also an hosting provider and version control platform you can use to 
        collaborate on open source projects and share files. 
        When you're using GitHub, you're working with Git beneath the hood.


* Install Git
* Check version

                git --version
* configure username and email for git
* Create a directory and initiliaze it in git

                git init
* Now we have a git repository (but its empty)
* Add some files to the directory and "add" them to the staging environment (not yet "commited")
  
                git add idk.md
                git add -all     or     git add -A
* Now we commit (commit is like saving)

                git commit -m "Some message you should write"
* The staging step is skippable yet not recommended
* Now check the log

                git log
*
