**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

    Artificial Intelligence refers to the broader field of creating systems or machines that can perform tasks 
    that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, 
    language understanding, and visual perception.


**Machine Learning (ML)**

    Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms and statistical 
    models to enable computers to perform specific tasks without using explicit instructions. Instead, ML systems 
    learn from patterns and inferences from data.


**Deep Learning (DL)**

    Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) 
    to model complex patterns in large amounts of data. DL is particularly effective for tasks such as image and 
    speech recognition.


**Data Science**

    Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge 
    of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data. Data scientists use techniques from 
    various fields, including ML, to analyze and interpret complex data.
